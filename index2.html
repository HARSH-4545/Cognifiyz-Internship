    <p style="color: rgb(235, 140, 7);text-align: left; font-weight: 500;"> We are an enthusiastic group of ecology and environmental
        science students and researchers from the University of <br>Edinburgh. We want to replace statistics anxiety and
        code fear with inspiration and motivation to learn. We believe<br> that coding can be really fun and also
        understand the importance of quantitative skills for professional development.<br>

        Over the last four years we have been writing tutorials as well as organising in-person and online workshops.
        All of<br> our materials are free for people to use and adapt - you can find more information on organising your
        own workshops <br>or using Coding Club tutorials in your teaching here.

        In autumn 2021, we are organising weekly in-person workshops<br> in Edinburgh and also live online workshops
        over Zoom. Check out our most recent tweets for information on signing <br>up for workshops!

        Coding Club is for everyone, regardless of their career stage or current level of knowledge.<br></p>
